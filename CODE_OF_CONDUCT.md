# Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering a _human_ environment, without forcing anyone to comply, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in this project -- and the community that may be built from it -- a _human_ experience. We will not purposefully discriminate against any aspect that defines someone as a person, but we will preserve our right to state the facts the way they are. Any one person's interactions with this project are not restricted to being “correct”, but rather on being right.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

 * Using welcoming and inclusive language
 * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, and being able to refute them with logic rather than discrimination.
 * Accepting constructive criticism where it is due
 * Focusing on what is best for the project
 * Showing empathy towards other contributers and comunity members where it is due

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

 * unwelcome sexual attention or advances,
 * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
 * Public harassment
 * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
 * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  loose professional setting

#### Clarification
We define “welcoming language” as being a teacher to someone who is clearly new to the environment; “inclusive” as including the person who is new to our environment in our way of working and interacting with each other.

We define “respect” just like the rest of the western world; we do not respect anything unless it is earned. Just because your view differs from ours does not mean it is better. These things should be up for debate in a less professional setting. In short: do *not* demand respect unless you have already proven your point and anyone is still not on board.

We define “showing empathy” as not replying or replying with a heartfelt comment whenever a touching subject is brought up. How a contributor or community member responds is up to them.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project owner at mail@cytodev.io. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
